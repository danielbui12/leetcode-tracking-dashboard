# LeetCode Tracker Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically detects LeetCode problems and allows you to track your progress in a side panel dashboard.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Automatic Problem Detection

## Technical Details

### Content Script (`content/content.js`)
- Runs on LeetCode problem pages
- Uses MutationObserver to detect dynamic content changes
- Extracts problem data using DOM selectors
- Sends data to background script via Chrome messaging

### Background Script (`background/background.js`)
- Service worker that monitors tab changes
- Manages communication between content script and side panel
- Handles side panel opening/closing
- Manages current problem state

### Side Panel (`sidepanel/`)
- Built React dashboard optimized for 400px width
- Uses Chrome storage API for data persistence
- Real-time updates from background script
- Responsive design for narrow panel

### Data Flow

1. **User navigates to LeetCode problem**
2. **Content script detects and crawls data**
3. **Background script receives data and updates state**
4. **Side panel receives update and shows "Add This Problem" button**
5. **User clicks button, form pre-fills with crawled data**
6. **User adds approach/notes and saves to Chrome storage**

## Development

### Building the Extension

```bash
# Build only the extension
npm run build:extension

# Build both dashboard and extension
npm run build:all
```

### File Structure

- `src/App.extension.tsx` - Extension-specific App component
- `src/components/ExtensionHeader.tsx` - Side panel header with problem detection
- `src/utils/extensionStorage.ts` - Chrome storage and messaging utilities
- `src/types/chrome.d.ts` - Chrome API type definitions

### Testing

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Navigate to a LeetCode problem
3. Verify the side panel opens and detects the problem
4. Test adding problems with both auto-detection and manual input
5. Verify data persists across browser restarts

## Permissions

The extension requires these permissions:

- `sidePanel` - To open the dashboard in a side panel
- `activeTab` - To read current tab information
- `storage` - To persist problem data
- `tabs` - To monitor tab changes and navigation
- `https://leetcode.com/*` - To access LeetCode pages for crawling

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 114+ (for side panel API)
- Edge 114+ (Chromium-based)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Detecting Problems
1. Refresh the LeetCode page
2. Check that the content script is loaded (F12 â†’ Console)
3. Verify the URL matches the pattern in manifest.json

### Side Panel Not Opening
1. Check that the extension is enabled
2. Try clicking the extension icon again
3. Check for errors in the background script (chrome://extensions/ â†’ Details â†’ Inspect views)

### Data Not Persisting
1. Check Chrome storage in DevTools (Application â†’ Storage â†’ Local Storage)
2. Verify the extension has storage permissions
3. Try refreshing the side panel
